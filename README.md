# CICIDS2017
This project analyzes network intrusion using the CICIDS2017_Thursday-WorkingHours-Morning-WebAttacks.csv dataset. After preprocessing and cleaning the data, multiple machine learning models (KNN, SVM, Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest, etc.) were applied. Their performance was compared to determine the most effective model for detecting web attacks.
